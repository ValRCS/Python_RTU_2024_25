# So we know our basic primitive data types
# we have int, float, str, bool
# but we also have a more complex data type called a list

# why should we need a list?
# let's see we want to store some numbers
a1 = 1
a2 = 2
a3 = 3
a4 = 5
a5 = 8
a6 = 13
# what do I do if I need to store 100 ? or 1 million numbers?

# to solve this Python  offers a list data type
# a list is a collection of items, a sequence of items
# a list can contain any data type, including other lists
# best use of lists is to store a collection of items of the same type


# what can we do with lists?
# 1. create a list
# 2. access items in a list - index based access
# 2a. - check for existence of an item in a list - membership operator
# 3. modify items in a list - mutable
# 4. add items to a list - dynamic size / resizable
# 5. remove items from a list - dynamic size / resizable
# 6. sort a list
# 7. reverse a list
# 8. iterate over a list - loop through a list
# 9. list comprehension - create a list from another list
# 10. other list methods - built in functions to work with lists
# 11. nested lists - list of lists
# 12. list slicing - get a sublist from a list
