# As our programs / code grow more complex, 
# we need to break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
# Functions are a way to do this.
#  Functions allow us to group related code together and give it a name.

# Functions are reusable pieces of code that can be called multiple times throughout a program.
# They can take inputs (called parameters or arguments) and return outputs (called return values).
# Functions can also be defined to not take any inputs or return any outputs.

# Functions let us abstract away the details of how something is done, so we can focus on what we want to do.
# This makes our code easier to read and understand.

# Ideal function does one thing and does it well.
# It should be small enough to be easily understood and tested.

# In real life you end up with functions that do more than one thing.
# This is not a problem as long as the function is still easy to understand and test.

# functions let us avoid repeating code. - DRY principle
# DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
# If you find yourself copying and pasting code, it's a sign that you should create a function.
# there are of course exceptions to this rule, but in general, if you find yourself copying and pasting code, it's a sign that you should create a function.
# Functions can also help us avoid bugs. If we have a piece of code that is used in multiple places, and we need to change it, we only have to change it in one place.

# Good function names are descriptive and indicate what the function does.
# Avoid using vague names like "do_something" or "function1".

# Let's look at what would lead us to create a function.
# we want to go eat lunch, but we need to do a few things first:
# 1. wash hands
# 2. make sandwich
# 3. eat sandwich
# 4. wash hands again

# I will emulate this with print
# print("Washing hands")
# print("Making sandwich")
# print("Eating sandwich")
# print("Washing hands again")
# This is a lot of repeated code.
# to avoid copy and pasting the same code over and over again, we can create a function.
# Let's create a function that does all of this for us.


def eat_lunch(): # again we use : to indicate that this is a function definition so indent the next lines
    # inner scope of function
    print("Washing hands")
    print("Making sandwich")

    # let's drink kefir
    print("Drinking kefir")

# function definition ends here

# # i could eat lunch 3 times 
# print("Let's eat lunch 3 times")
# for _ in range(3): # _ is just a variable but we are saying we do not care about it
#     eat_lunch() # this is a function call, we are calling the function we just defined

# let's make a function make and eat something
