# string is a sequence (ordered collection)
# of single letter strings in Python

# Python strings are immutable
# means we do not change them - we can overwrite
# but we do not change individual characters in same string
# instead when we modify string we create a new one

food = "Sushi"
# in Python no difference between " and ' for string
drink = 'Green Tee'
print(food, drink)
# so if i want ' inside I use " outside
quoted_text = "It's a sunny day, isn't it?"
print(quoted_text)

another_quote = 'It is a "sunny" day indeed today'
print(another_quote)

# so if I need both
# I have a couple of choices
# I could use so called escape characters
# all escape chars: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences

escaped_text = "some text with \"quote\" also normal 'quote' inside"
print(escaped_text)

#if i need \ in the text I can use \\ - this is ONE \
more_escaped_text = "some backslash \\ and newlines\n\n\n and tab\t\t\taha"
print(more_escaped_text)

# we also have raw strings no escape allowed!
raw_text = r"double backslash \\ or \n \t or anything \ really"
print(raw_text)
# r"text" is good for things like regular expressions which need more escaping

# we also have so called multiline strings
# starts and ends with """ or '''
multi_line_string = """Rakstu ko gribu,
\tlasu ko gribu,
\tdziedu ko gribu,
Ä“du ko gribu,
dzeru, ko gribu

Un tad "skrienu", kur gribu"""
